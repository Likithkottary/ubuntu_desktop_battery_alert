# ubuntu_desktop_battery_alert - 29/07/2025
A simple script that alerts you when your battery goes above 85% or below 35%, helping you prolong battery life by avoiding overcharging and deep discharging. Easy to customize and lightweight.

I have tested this on ubuntu 22.04 with python3.10.12 and have placed this script in autostart

Install

sudo apt install libnotify-bin # libnotify is a library used on Linux systems (especially GNOME-based desktops like Ubuntu) to display desktop notifications 
sudo apt install pulseaudio-utils # paplay a command-line audio player from PulseAudio.
